## 1. Introduction to Angular

Angular is a TypeScript-based front-end framework by Google, designed for building scalable, single-page applications (SPAs). With a component-based structure, Angular allows modularity, reusability, and a robust development experience.

## 2. Setting Up an Angular Project

### Install Angular CLI
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli

## 1. Introduction to Angular

Angular is a TypeScript-based front-end framework by Google, designed for building scalable, single-page applications (SPAs). With a component-based structure, Angular allows modularity, reusability, and a robust development experience.

## 2. Setting Up an Angular Project

Install Angular CLI by running: `npm install -g @angular/cli`

Create a New Project: `ng new project-name`

Run the Application: `ng serve`

## 3. Core Angular Concepts

- **Modules**: Organize the app into cohesive blocks of functionality.
- **Components**: Building blocks of Angular applications, managing view logic.
- **Templates**: Define component views using HTML, directives, and binding.
- **Directives**: Extend HTML with custom behaviors like `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, etc.
- **Data Binding**: Synchronize data between model and view.
  - **Interpolation**: `{{ value }}`
  - **Property Binding**: `[property]="value"`
  - **Event Binding**: `(event)="function()"`
- **Pipes**: Transform data in the template using `| date`, `| uppercase`, etc.

## 4. Components in Angular

### Creating a Component
Run: `ng generate component component-name`

### Component Structure
Each component consists of:
1. TypeScript file (logic)
2. HTML file (template/view)
3. CSS file (styling)

### Basic Component Example
1. Import `{ Component }` from Angular core.
2. Use `@Component` decorator with `selector`, `templateUrl`, and `styleUrls`.
3. Create a `class ComponentNameComponent` to define component logic.

## 5. Services and Dependency Injection

Services provide shared data and logic across components.

### Creating a Service
Run: `ng generate service service-name`

### Using Dependency Injection in Components
1. Import `ServiceName` from the service file.
2. Inject the service in the component's constructor by using `private serviceName: ServiceName`.

## 6. Routing in Angular

### Setting Up Routes
1. Import `{ RouterModule, Routes }` from `@angular/router`.
2. Define routes using the `Routes` array. Example: `{ path: 'path', component: ComponentName }`.
3. Add `<router-outlet></router-outlet>` in `app.component.html`.

## 7. API Integration with HTTP Client

### Setup HTTP Client
1. Import `HttpClientModule` in `app.module.ts`.
2. Use `HttpClient` in a service to make API calls. Define `getData` and `postData` methods that return an observable for API responses.

### Making API Requests in Components
- Use `this.apiService.getData().subscribe(data => console.log(data))`.
- Use `this.apiService.postData({ key: 'value' }).subscribe(response => console.log(response))`.

## 8. Observables and RxJS

Observables are a key part of Angular's async data handling. They manage async operations like API calls and real-time data streams.

### Example Observable Usage
- Import `Observable` from `rxjs`.
- Return an observable by calling `this.http.get<DataType>(url)`.

### Common RxJS Operators
- **map**: Transform each item
- **filter**: Filter items by condition
- **catchError**: Handle errors in streams

## 9. Angular Forms

Angular supports two types of forms:
1. **Template-driven Forms**: Form controls are defined in the HTML.
2. **Reactive Forms**: Form controls are created and managed in code.

### Template-driven Form Example
Create an HTML form with `#form="ngForm"` and bind `ngModel` for each input.

### Reactive Form Example
1. Import `FormBuilder` and `FormGroup`.
2. Create a form group with fields using `this.fb.group({ username: [''], email: [''] })`.

## 10. Common Angular CLI Commands

- Generate a Component: `ng generate component component-name`
- Generate a Service: `ng generate service service-name`
- Build the Project: `ng build`
- Run Tests: `ng test`
